Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about coding, learning, and creating something new. Here's a bit about me:

### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm just getting started with coding and diving into the world of software development. Right now, I’m exploring how things work behind the scenes—whether it’s building websites, writing programs, or just figuring things out one bug at a time.

I love solving problems and am always looking for ways to learn by doing. I’m working on small projects, picking up new skills, and getting comfortable with different tools and languages. If you're learning too, or just want to chat tech, feel free to reach out!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- Java
- Git

### 🚀 My Coding Journey

This is just the beginning of my coding journey, and I’m enjoying every step of it. After getting a handle on some fundamentals, I jumped into my first real project—a capstone!

- 🧾 **[Capstone 1 - Accounting Ledger](https://github.com/AbrahamGhani/Capstones/tree/main/Capstone1-AccountingLedger)**  
  This project was a great intro to both programming and accounting concepts. It gave me the chance to build something functional while learning how to plan and organize code in a project setting.

More projects are on the way as I continue to learn and grow. Stay tuned for updates!
