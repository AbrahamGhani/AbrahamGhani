# Abraham Ghani

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in backend engineering, application security, and DevOps fundamentals. I am currently expanding my skills through real-world projects, capstones, and hands-on internship experience.

My goal is to contribute to a development team where I can build reliable applications, write clean and maintainable code, and continue growing as a professional in the software engineering field.

## About Me

I am a security-focused software developer with experience building backend applications using Java, REST APIs, and SQL. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end and translating that knowledge into practical solutions. My background includes writing secure code, debugging issues across different layers of an application, and working in Agile environments.

I learn best by doing and have completed multiple capstone projects and a professional internship that reflect real development workflows, from design and implementation to testing and documentation.
