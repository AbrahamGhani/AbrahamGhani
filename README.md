Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about coding, learning, and creating something new. Here's a bit about me:

### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm new to the world of coding and currently exploring the exciting possibilities that come with learning how to build software. I'm passionate about problem-solving and eager to grow my skills in web development, programming, and all things tech.

I'm currently focused on learning the basics, building small projects, and getting hands-on experience with different tools and languages. I'm always open to connecting with other learners and developers—feel free to reach out!


### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- Java
- Git

### 🚀 My Coding Journey

I'm at the beginning of my coding journey and excited to learn and grow in the world of software development. I started by getting familiar with the basics and gradually building small projects to apply what I'm learning.

One of my first major steps was completing a capstone project:

- 🧾 **[Capstone 1 - Accounting Ledger](https://github.com/AbrahamGhani/Capstones/tree/main/Capstone1-AccountingLedger)**  
  This project helped me understand basic accounting principles while applying them in a simple ledger system. It was a great way to practice fundamental coding skills and project organization.

I'm continuously working on more capstones and personal projects as I gain more experience. Stay tuned!
